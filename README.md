# flask-animal-camouflage
A quick game to showcase animal adaptation with camouflage

Students will have a random selection of camouflaged and revealed animals. They must click on the animal to score a point. The time it takes for the animal to be clicked is recorded. At the end, they are shown the average times of finding a camouflaged animal and one in the open. This will showcase why camouflage is used: it makes it harder to find an animal.

## TODO

- Create session to track game.
- Get more expose images.
- Resize expose images.
- Try to find credit for camo images.
